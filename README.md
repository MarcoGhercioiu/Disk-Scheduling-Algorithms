# Disk-Scheduling-Algorithms
A Monte Carlo simulation to study the performance of the FIFO, SSTF, SCAN, and LIFO algorithms for 50 to 150 in steps of 10 I/O requests at a time with a hypothetical HDD which operates at 12,000 RPM, has an average seek time of 2.5 ms, a transfer rate of 6 GB/s, 201 tracks, 360 sectors per track, and a block size of 4 KB.
